Bindings Modules
----------------

The core Unfiltered library does not depend on or reference any server
backend. It defines internal abstractions for requests and responses
and provides common matchers and writers in those terms.

An application or library that depends only on the core library would
be used with any backend that Unfiltered supports. In most cases you
will choose a *binding* module, which links Unfiltered's request and
response vocabulary to the backend.

### Servlet Filters (unfiltered-filter)

The Java Servlet API enables you to write applications that run on
servlet containers, anything from Tomcat to Google App Engine. With
Unfiltered you can write these filter classes in a few lines of Scala,
and run them almost anywhere.

### Netty Channels (unfiltered-netty)
