Bindings and Servers
--------------------

The core Unfiltered library does not depend on or reference any
particular server backend. It defines internal abstractions for
requests and responses and defines matchers and writers in those
terms.

An application or library that depends only on the core library could
be used with any backend that Unfiltered supports, but in most cases you
will choose a *binding* module.

### Binding Modules

These bind Unfiltered's request and response vocabulary to lower
level implementations.

#### Servlet Filters (unfiltered-filter)

The Java Servlet API enables you to write applications that run on
servlet containers, anything from Tomcat to Google App Engine. With
Unfiltered you can write these filter classes in a few lines of Scala,
and run them almost anywhere.

#### Netty Channels (unfiltered-netty)

Netty defines *channels* for network I/O and implements them using
Java's Native I/O (NIO) interface. Channels are a better match than
the Servlet API for web applications that do follow an immediate
request-response pattern.
